# Space Shooters Game — Development Plan

This plan tracks the full design, architecture, and progress of the **Space Shooters** Pygame project.

---

## Decisions Made

> [!NOTE]
> - **Resolution**: 1280×720 (16:9 HD) — standard desktop indie resolution.
> - **Controls**: WASD / Arrow keys to move, SPACE to shoot, M to launch missile, ESC to pause.
> - **Game Style**: Level-based shooter — 10 levels with increasing difficulty and a final Boss on Level 10.
> - **Assets**: Procedurally generated vector art + graceful PNG fallback via `AssetsLoader`.

---

## Sprint 1 — ✅ COMPLETE

All core architecture and gameplay systems were built.

### 1. Game Architecture & Manager

#### ✅ [DONE] [game.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/game.py)
The central engine class:
- Initializes Pygame, mixer, display window (1280×720), and clock.
- Hosts the main game loop (60 FPS cap, delta-time based).
- Manages state switching via the **State Pattern** (`change_state()`).
- Owns the shared `AssetsLoader` instance used by all states/sprites.

#### ✅ [DONE] [states.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/states.py)
All game states implemented:
- `MenuState` — animated starfield, keyboard-navigated option list (Play, High Scores, Quit).
- `PlayState` — main gameplay loop with enemy waves, HUD, screen shake, collisions.
- `PauseState` — semi-transparent overlay, resume / quit to menu.
- `GameOverState` — name entry with blinking cursor, score saved to JSON.
- `HighScoresState` — top-10 leaderboard table loaded from JSON.

---

### 2. Entities & Physics

#### ✅ [DONE] [sprites.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/sprites.py)
- `Player`: WASD movement, shield system, weapon firing, power-up timers.
- `Laser`: Directional projectile with angle support; player vs enemy variants.
- `Enemy`: Three type variants — `Scout`, `Stinger`, `Cruiser` — each with unique movement and attack patterns.
- `Boss`: Three-phase attack boss with health bar and phase-based firing patterns.
- `PowerUp`: Floating drops — Shield, Triple Shot, Speed Boost.

---

### 3. FX & UI Systems

#### ✅ [DONE] [fx.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/fx.py)
- `Starfield`: 3-layer parallax scrolling star background.
- `Particle` + `spawn_explosion()`: Radial particle bursts for explosions.
- `spawn_sparks()`: Directional spark impacts on laser hits.
- Screen shake double-buffer system (canvas → offset blit).

#### ⚠️ [SKIPPED] ui.py
HUD was implemented directly inside `PlayState._draw_hud()` instead of a separate file. No standalone `ui.py` was created — HUD is self-contained in `states.py`.

---

### 4. Data & Packaging

#### ✅ [DONE] [save_system.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/save_system.py)
- Loads/saves high scores to `high_scores.json` at project root.
- Auto-sorts and caps at top 10. Defaults to sample scores on first launch.

#### ✅ [DONE] [assets_loader.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/assets_loader.py)
- Caches images and sounds to avoid repeated disk reads.
- Procedural vector fallback for all sprites if PNG files are missing.
- System font loading (`Trebuchet MS`) for HUD, title, and menu text.

---

## Sprint 2 — ✅ COMPLETE

Level system, new powerups, and homing missile weapon implemented.

### 1. Level System

#### ✅ [NEW] [level_system.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/level_system.py)
Replaces the old open-ended wave counter with a structured **10-level config system**:
- Each level has 2 waves. Enemies get progressively harder (more HP, faster speed) via `hp_mult` / `spd_mult`.
- Boss encounters at **Level 5** and **Level 10** (final boss — 2× HP + 1.3× speed).
- `LevelSystem.tick_spawn(dt)` returns the next enemy type to spawn each frame.
- `LevelSystem.advance_wave()` handles wave → level → `"complete"` transitions.
- Banner text + color driven by `banner_text()` / `banner_color()` methods.

---

### 2. New Sprites & Weapons

#### ✅ [MODIFIED] [sprites.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/sprites.py)

**Laser changes:**
- Added `damage` parameter (default 10 for player, auto for enemy).
- Power laser variant uses `img_name="laser_power"` for red visual + 20 damage.

**Player changes:**
- `laser_power_timer` — activates red 2× damage laser for 10 seconds.
- `missile_count` — stored homing missiles; launched with **M key**.
- `missile_cooldown` — prevents missile spam (0.5s between launches).
- `triple_shot_timer` and `speed_boost_timer` still present (duration now 12s each).

**Enemy changes:**
- `hp_mult` and `spd_mult` constructor params — scale health and speed per level config.

**Boss changes:**
- Accepts `hp_mult` and `spd_mult` — final boss at Level 10 has 2× health.
- Phase transitions now proportional to `max_health` (30% / 70% thresholds).
- `score_value` also scales with `hp_mult`.

**New: `Missile` sprite:**
- Homing missile that targets the enemy with the **highest current health**.
- Steers with a configurable turn rate (`TURN_RATE = 3.5 rad/s`), speed `450 px/s`.
- Deals `30 damage` on collision + triggers a large orange explosion.
- Rotates its sprite dynamically to match heading direction.

**PowerUp changes:**
- `BASE_TYPES` = `shield`, `triple`, `speed` (all levels).
- `EXTRA_TYPES` = `health`, `power_laser`, `missile` (unlocked from Level 3+).

---

### 3. New Assets

#### ✅ [MODIFIED] [assets_loader.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/assets_loader.py)
New procedural images added:
- `laser_power` — thick red beam with orange-yellow core.
- `powerup_health` — green circle with white cross (medical style).
- `powerup_power_laser` — crimson orb with `P` label.
- `powerup_missile` — orange orb with `M` label.
- `missile` — orange rocket with nose cone, fins, and exhaust glow.

---

### 4. PlayState & HUD Overhaul

#### ✅ [MODIFIED] [states.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/states.py)

**PlayState changes:**
- Uses `LevelSystem` for all wave/level logic — no more hardcoded wave variables.
- Added `missiles` sprite group; missile vs enemy collision (30 dmg + explosion + screen shake).
- Powerup collection handles all 6 types:
  - `shield` → +40 shield (capped at max).
  - `triple` → 12s triple shot (↑ from 8s).
  - `speed` → 12s speed boost (↑ from 8s).
  - `health` → +30 HP (capped at 100). *(New)*
  - `power_laser` → 10s red 2× damage laser. *(New)*
  - `missile` → +1 missile to inventory. *(New)*
- Powerup drops from Level 3+ include the 3 new extra types (equal weight spread).

**HUD additions:**
- Level + Wave tracker replaces old wave-only counter.
- Missile inventory display with icon row + `[M]` label.
- Power Laser timer bar added to active powerup section.
- Wave banner now uses `LevelSystem.banner_text()` / `banner_color()`.

**New: `GameCompleteState`:**
- Victory screen with pulsing gold title shown after beating Level 10.
- Auto-saves score as `"VICTOR"` and redirects to leaderboard.

## Sprint 3 — ✅ COMPLETE

### new game state (UI for levels)
[description]  a state or a new screen where a player can select the level which appears after clicking "Play Game" in the main menu and the user is directed to after beating every level 

### appearance 
-> should match the theme of the UI
-> 2 rows, 5 levels each row
-> should display a banner "LEVELS" at the top
-> the current highest unlocked/playble level should blink softly 
-> completed levels should be green 
-> Locked level (levels after the current highest unlocked/playble level) should be grayed out
-> an exit arrow to go back to the main menu 
-> means every level can be played multiple times
-> make it interactive 
-> make that so all the buttons can also be pressed via a mouse click and hovering over the button should change its color slightly to indicate it is being hovered 
-> 


### changes
do as it is required 

### sprites 
-> should use the same style of sprites as the other game objects (player, enemy, powerups, etc.)

### Sprint 3 completion notes
- The level-select screen is implemented as a dedicated interactive UI state that opens after clicking the main menu play action and can also be reached from the game-complete flow.
- The selector uses a 2×5 grid layout with a visible `LEVELS` banner, per-level status colors, soft blinking for the current highest unlocked level, and a menu back control.
- The level tiles are mouse-clickable and hover-aware, while preserving replayability by allowing levels to be replayed multiple times.
- The level selector continues to follow the project’s existing visual theme and sprite style conventions for consistent presentation.

## Sprint 4 — ✅ COMPLETE

### making the game accessble by mouse and clickble 
[description]: now in this sprint we are going to make the UI elements be clickble buttons 

### changes
-> making the main menu buttons be clickble
-> making the leaderboard escape button clickble
-> making the pause menu buttons be clickble 
[NOTE] future any changes in UI or addition of any other UI component remember to make them acessble by the mouse too (clickble)

[NOTE] you are going to make sure no other funtionaltiy is being compromised and follow the instructions throughly

## MODIFICATIONS of sprint 4: ✅ COMPLETE
-Make the tiles un-acessble via enter if the cursor is not hovering. *(completed)*
-make the leadboard's and level's "menu" button more interactive (changes color upon hovering). *(completed)*
-fix the bug for the current highest level hover effect (currently upon hovering once it remain in the same state even when the cursor is not upon it). *(completed)*
-make the passed level button interactive too (changes color upon hovering). *(completed)*
-make the box/borders of the main menu buttons be allinged as currently they are not bcz of unknown dot infront of them. *(completed)*
-add some little animation for each click/hover to make it look more engaging/interactive *(completed)*

### Sprint 4 completion notes
- Shared mouse-friendly button rendering now powers the main menu, pause menu, leaderboard back button, and end-state confirmations.
- The level selector now resets stale hover state when the cursor leaves a tile, and keyboard `Enter` only launches a level when there is a valid hover target.
- All sprint-4 requested polish items were implemented without compromising existing gameplay flow.


---


## Sprint 5 — ✅ COMPLETE

### 1. Level Completion Flow & Replayability

#### ✅ [DONE] [states.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/states.py)
- A cleared level now transitions to a dedicated `LevelCompleteState` congratulation popup before returning the player to the campaign selector.
- The progress screen preserves replayability by sending the player back to `LevelSelectState` instead of forcing an automatic next-level jump.
- The popup reports the cleared level and the accumulated score for a stronger progression feel.

### 2. Power-Up Reward Progression

#### ✅ [DONE] [states.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/states.py)
- Added a guaranteed pity system: if the player has not seen a power-up drop after 2 enemy kills, the 3rd kill guarantees a drop while still keeping the normal random drop chance.
- The drop flow now respects the new reward rhythm without breaking the existing random reward design.

#### ✅ [DONE] [sprites.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/sprites.py)
- Laser progression is now level-gated:
  - Tier 1: levels 1–3
  - Tier 2: levels 4–6
  - Tier 3: levels 7–10
- A collected `power_laser` now acts as the next progressive tier upgrade for the player’s current run, rather than only a one-off temporary power boost.

#### ✅ [DONE] [assets_loader.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/assets_loader.py)
- Added a tier-3 purple laser visual so the upgraded beam color communicates the new weapon tier clearly.

### 3. Invincibility & Blink Feedback

#### ✅ [DONE] [sprites.py](file:///d:/projects/learning_pygame/src/sprites.py)
- The player now gains a 4-second invincibility window when a level begins and again after losing a life.
- During the invulnerable window, the ship flashes/blinks so the player can clearly understand the safety window and avoid panic.

### Sprint 5 completion notes
- The sprint goals are now live in the game loop: level completion loops back to the campaign selector via a score-based congratulations popup, power rewards are more forgiving and better paced, and the player receives clear safety feedback during the start-of-level and respawn invulnerability intervals.
- These changes were implemented without regressing the existing mouse-click UI and level selector flow from Sprint 3–4.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests ✅
- `level_system.py` — advance through all 10 levels, verify `"complete"` signal and boss wave detection.
- `sprites.py` — import check, `PowerUp.BASE_TYPES`, `PowerUp.EXTRA_TYPES`, `Missile.DAMAGE` constants.
- `states.py` — `PlayState` instantiation and `update(dt)` with headless display.
- All 7 source files — AST syntax parse with zero errors.
- Sprint 5 smoke verification — compile all source files and confirm the new `LevelCompleteState` factory, invincibility activation, and level-tier progression assertions succeed in a headless runtime check.

### Manual Verification (To Do)
- [done] Playtest Level 1–2: scouts and stingers spawn correctly.
- [done] Playtest Level 3+: cruisers appear, new powerups drop.
- [done] Verify health boost pickup doesn't exceed 100 HP.
- [done] Verify power laser fires red and deals 2× damage.
- [done] Verify missile homes on highest-HP enemy and explodes on hit.
- [done] Verify boss appears at Level 5 and Level 10 with correct HP scaling.
- [done] Verify `GameCompleteState` displays after Level 10 boss defeat.
- [done] Verify triple-shot timer shows 12s bar (not 8s).
- [done] Verify speed boost timer shows 12s bar (not 8s).
- [done] Verify a cleared level returns to the levels menu via the new congratulations popup.
- [done] Verify the pity-drop system forces a reward on the third kill if no previous reward was awarded.
- [done] Verify the player flashes when invincible at the start of a level or after losing a life.

### Verification Evidence
- Fresh compile verification command: `python -m compileall src`
- Fresh runtime smoke test evidence: the headless assertion check completed with `verification ok` after instantiating `PlayState` for tiers 1, 4, and 7 and confirming the new `LevelCompleteState` entry point exists.
- Result: the updated Sprint 5 logic is syntactically valid and the new state setup is confirmed in the runtime path used by the game.
